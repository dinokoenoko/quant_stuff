S&P 500 and Bonds Allocation Analysis with Monte Carlo Simulation

This project explores portfolio allocation between the S&P 500 and bonds and it allows interactive editing of the allocation amount, analyzing the impact of different allocations on portfolio performance. It uses historical data from FRED (Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis) and simulates future scenarios using Random Brownian Motion to assess risk and return possibilities. The kit is used in EDHEC Portfolio Management with Python Course. 


Features:

Interactive allocation analysis between S&P 500 and bonds by ipwidgets

Calculation of wealth evolution, monthly returns, and summary statistics including:

Annualized return

Annualized volatility

Sharpe ratio

Maximum drawdown

Skewness and kurtosis

Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR (CVaR)

Monte Carlo simulations using customizable parameters for drift, volatility, and rebalance frequency.

Visualizations of portfolio wealth and distribution for different allocation scenarios.

The project shows practical portfolio management, risk assessment, and Monte Carlo techniques in Python using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and ipywidgets for interactive analysis.
